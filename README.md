# NCL (Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning)

This is the official PyTorch implementation for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06200):

## Overview

We propose a contrastive learning paradigm, named Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning (**NCL**), to explicitly capture potential node relatedness into contrastive learning for graph collaborative filtering.

## Requirements

```
recbole==1.0.0
python==3.7.7
pytorch==1.7.1
faiss-gpu==1.7.1
cudatoolkit==10.1
```

## Quick Start

```bash
python main.py --dataset ml-1m
```

You can replace `ml-1m` to `yelp`, `amazon-books`, `gowalla-merged` or `alibaba` to reproduce the results reported in our paper.

## Datasets

For `alibaba`, you can download `alibaba.zip` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Th7ii_Z0l6AjGq8zWsKuLVCsacIO1AQJ/view?usp=sharing). Then,
```bash
mkdir dataset
mv alibaba.zip dataset
unzip alibaba.zip
python main.py --dataset alibaba
```

For others, they will be downloaded automatically via RecBole once you run the main program. Take `yelp` for example,
```bash
python main.py --dataset yelp
```

## Customized datasets

To run NCL on customized datasets, please following https://github.com/RUCAIBox/NCL/issues/1#issuecomment-1076370560.

## Acknowledgement

The implementation is based on the open-source recommendation library [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole).
